# odin-library
The Library project from The Odin Project's Javascript course

This was a project where we had to create a book constructor to store information in an array of book objects. Then, we built a website that required DOM manipulation to add books via a form and submit event listener, remove the book based on the button, and change the read status based on a different button. 

My focus was to learn about objects and constructors, and of course the "this" statement, but also to ensure the data in the array and objects were being edited, not just what we see in the DOM. I know when we start working with databases and saving our changes, it will matter a lot more than just changing whats on the website/DOM.

I had fun with this! I didn't add too much CSS, just practiced a combination of flexbox and grid in order to lay things out in a visually appealing way.
